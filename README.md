# Unicorn-Data-Analysis-With-SQL

The project involves analyzing a dataset of unicorn companies in SQL. Unicorns are privately held companies valued at over $1 billion as of November 2021.
The project includes data creation, analysis using SQL, and answering specific questions about the dataset. The data has been extracted from ChatGPT for practice. 

Using SQL, I explored the following questions:

1- Top 5 Countries by Number of Unicorns 
2- Top 3 Sectors by Average Valuation 
3- Unicorns Founded After 2010 
4- Total Valuation of Unicorns in the FinTech Sector 
5- Most Common Investors
